#Project description
The goal of this project is to create a tidy data set from the raw data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The output data set contains the means for each subject and each activity of the means or standard deviations of variables including but not limited to triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration), the estimated body acceleration, and triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

#Collecting the raw data
The raw data set is downloaded from the link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

For completion, we include the following description of the experiment from which the raw data is collected:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

#Creating the tidy data
With the raw data set stored in the working directory, the following steps create the tidy data set.

1. Loading the data files into variables
2. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
3. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
6. From the data set in previous step, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
7. Saving the tidy data set

As a reference, below are the components of a tidy data set:

1. Each variable you measure should be in one column.
2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.
3. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable.
4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked.
